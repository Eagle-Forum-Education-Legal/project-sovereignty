      "Culture increasingly mocks what was once sacred, as seen in an Austrian art exhibit that presented blasphemous Christian imagery during Advent.",
    body: `An Austrian exhibition titled "You shall make for yourself an image" deliberately blasphemed Christianity during Advent. Works included a man dressed as Mary holding baby Jesus in an LGBT context, the crucifixion as an erotic symbol, and a nude woman cradling a Christ figure who died of a heroin overdose. Pop culture similarly inverts morality, recasting villains as heroes in films like "Wicked: For Good."

The relentless assault on Christian imagery in Western art has accelerated in recent years, with galleries and museums choosing shock value over genuine artistic expression. These provocations are rarely directed at other religions, revealing a specific cultural hostility toward the Christian faith that undergirds Western civilization.

Phyllis Schlafly warned decades ago that the erosion of respect for traditional values in the arts was a harbinger of deeper cultural decay. When a society's artists can no longer distinguish between the sacred and the profane, the society itself loses its moral compass. The remedy is not censorship but a renewed commitment to beauty, truth, and the transcendent values that inspire great art.`,

    excerpt:
      "Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai was imprisoned for speaking against tyranny, illustrating how fragile free expression remains globally and in American institutions.",
    body: `Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong media mogul, faced repeated imprisonment for opposing the Chinese Communist regime. His conviction for "subversive activities" demonstrates that even the exceptionally accomplished cannot escape authoritarian suppression. Meanwhile, American college campuses recorded record free-speech violations in 2025, with administrators threatening funding cuts to silence controversial student voices.

The parallels between authoritarian speech suppression abroad and the creeping intolerance on American campuses should alarm every citizen who values the First Amendment. When universities—once bastions of free inquiry—punish students for expressing unpopular opinions, they betray their core mission.

Phyllis Schlafly spent her career defending the right of Americans to speak freely on matters of public concern, from her early battles over national defense policy to her later fights against political correctness in education. Her example reminds us that free speech must be actively defended in every generation, because the forces that seek to silence dissent never rest.`,

    excerpt:
      "February celebrates national heroes like George Washington, yet political correctness in schools has replaced patriotism with multiculturalism and global citizenship concepts.",
    body: `Federal law designates the third Monday in February as "Washington's Birthday," not "Presidents' Day." Political correctness in education over the past decade has eliminated national heroes while replacing patriotism with multiculturalism and diversity concepts. Modern textbooks emphasize American faults rather than remarkable achievements and the foundational principles that generated unprecedented innovation.

The deliberate downgrading of American patriotism in public education represents one of the most consequential cultural shifts of the past half-century. When children are taught to be ashamed of their country rather than proud of its accomplishments, the foundation of self-governance crumbles.

Phyllis Schlafly championed the teaching of American history as a story of extraordinary achievement—a nation founded on the radical idea that rights come from God, not government. She understood that an informed, patriotic citizenry is the ultimate safeguard of liberty, and she worked tirelessly to ensure that future generations would learn the true story of America's founding and greatness.`,

    excerpt:
      "Liberal judges extensively employ \"show cause\" orders against the Trump Administration\u2019s detention policy for illegal aliens, contradicting established legal precedent.",
    body: `Federal judges, predominantly appointed by Democrats, have issued dozens of "show cause" orders objecting to Trump Administration detention of undocumented immigrants without bail. These judges permit bail denial for January 6th defendants but oppose detaining illegal aliens. Trump's policy aligns with established law: individuals unlawfully present face mandatory detention without release on bail.

The double standard in judicial treatment of different categories of defendants reveals the politicization of the federal bench. Judges who enthusiastically upheld pretrial detention for political protesters now suddenly discover constitutional concerns when the same principle is applied to immigration enforcement.

This pattern of judicial activism was a central concern of Phyllis Schlafly throughout her career. She argued forcefully that unelected judges should not be permitted to substitute their policy preferences for the will of the people as expressed through their elected representatives. The current conflict over immigration enforcement is the latest chapter in that ongoing struggle.`,

    excerpt:
      "Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns reframes the American Revolution through Critical Theory, but historical figures like Benjamin Rush demonstrate that founding principles were rooted in Christian conviction.",
    body: `Ken Burns proposes "rethinking the American Revolution" through a Critical Theory lens, emphasizing flaws while minimizing foundational truths. However, this approach misses the larger narrative: independence fundamentally represented self-governance, moral truth, and human dignity grounded in a Christian worldview. Dr. Benjamin Rush, a Declaration signer, exemplified bold opposition to slavery, understanding that "God-given rights" must apply universally.

Historical revisionism of the kind practiced by Burns and others seeks to undermine the moral authority of America's founding by focusing exclusively on the gap between ideals and practice. But this criticism, while sometimes valid in its particulars, misses the revolutionary significance of those ideals themselves—ideals that provided the very framework for correcting injustice.

Phyllis Schlafly devoted considerable energy to combating historical revisionism in American education. She understood that the goal of revisionists was not merely to "correct the record" but to delegitimize the American experiment itself. Her response was always to point to the extraordinary achievements made possible by the principles of liberty, self-governance, and individual rights enshrined in the Declaration and Constitution.`,

    excerpt:
      "A Maine custody order barred a mother from taking her daughter to church or reading the Bible without paternal consent, raising serious First Amendment concerns.",
    body: `Emily Bickford holds primary custody of her 12-year-old daughter Ava, but a December 2024 Maine court order grants the father exclusive control over all religious decisions. The order prohibits the child from attending church services, reading religious materials, or maintaining contact with faith community members unless approved. Legal advocates argue this unprecedented ruling violates religious liberty and parental rights.

The case represents an alarming expansion of judicial power into the most intimate sphere of family life. Courts have traditionally been reluctant to interfere with parents' rights to raise their children according to their own religious convictions, recognizing that this freedom is protected by both the First Amendment and the fundamental liberty interest in family integrity.

This case is precisely the type of government overreach that Phyllis Schlafly spent her life fighting. She believed that parents—not judges, bureaucrats, or social workers—have the primary right and responsibility to direct the upbringing of their children, including their moral and religious formation. The Maine ruling represents a dangerous precedent that threatens the religious liberty of every American family.`,

    excerpt:
      "Communities nationwide increasingly oppose Big Tech data centers due to environmental strain, water depletion, and resource consumption without proportional local benefits.",
    body: `Matthews, North Carolina residents opposed a proposed data center with overwhelming local consensus. Data centers consume massive quantities of land, electricity, and water while generating minimal local employment and producing constant 65-decibel noise. Texas facilities require millions of gallons daily for cooling—equivalent to a town of 50,000 people's consumption.

The explosive growth of data centers, driven largely by the demands of artificial intelligence, is creating a new category of environmental and quality-of-life concerns for communities across America. Unlike traditional industries that bring jobs and economic activity, data centers employ very few people relative to the resources they consume.

The grassroots opposition to data centers echoes the kind of citizen activism that Phyllis Schlafly championed throughout her career. She believed that local communities should have a meaningful voice in decisions that affect their quality of life, and that Big Tech companies should not be permitted to impose costs on communities while capturing all the benefits for themselves.`,

    excerpt:
      "Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch warns that civic ignorance poses America\u2019s greatest internal threat, urging education in foundational principles and shared national history.",
    body: `Justice Gorsuch cautions that America faces its greatest danger internally through civic ignorance and division rather than external threats. He promotes his children's book highlighting the Declaration's "radical ideas": universal equality, unalienable God-given rights, and popular sovereignty. Alarming statistics reveal most Americans cannot name the three government branches, and over half would fail naturalization tests.

The crisis of civic literacy is not merely an academic concern but a direct threat to the survival of constitutional self-governance. A citizenry that does not understand its own system of government cannot effectively participate in it, hold its leaders accountable, or resist encroachments on its liberties.

Phyllis Schlafly was a passionate advocate for civic education throughout her career. She wrote extensively about the importance of teaching American history and government in schools, and she founded Eagle Forum in part to ensure that ordinary citizens would have the knowledge and tools to participate effectively in the democratic process. Justice Gorsuch's warning validates her lifelong conviction that an educated citizenry is the foundation of a free society.`,

    excerpt:
      "The Trump administration overhauled Dietary Guidelines, inverting traditional recommendations to prioritize whole foods over processed items under RFK Jr.\u2019s health initiative.",
    body: `Trump administration officials announced significant Dietary Guidelines revisions aimed at reversing decades favoring corporate interests over public health. RFK Jr. criticized previous guidance as "lies to protect corporate profit-taking," promoting processed foods and refined carbohydrates. New recommendations emphasize whole, nutrient-dense foods including quality proteins, healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables in an inverted pyramid model.

The overhaul of federal dietary guidance represents a significant break from the cozy relationship between food industry lobbyists and government regulators that has characterized nutrition policy for decades. Previous guidelines, heavily influenced by the processed food industry, contributed to epidemic levels of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

The fight over dietary guidelines illustrates a broader principle that Phyllis Schlafly articulated throughout her career: government bureaucracies are easily captured by special interests and do not always act in the public interest. She advocated for policies that empower individuals and families to make their own informed choices, rather than relying on government experts whose recommendations may be shaped by political and financial pressures.`,

    excerpt:
      "Military deployment of AI proved effective, but tech companies\u2019 usage restrictions create tension with Pentagon leadership over national security priorities.",
    body: `Claude, an AI program used in the U.S. military and eight of ten largest companies, reportedly assisted in capturing Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro in January. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth threatens to ban Claude company-wide from military supply chains due to Anthropic's usage restrictions via their Acceptable Use Policy. The military demands unrestricted AI capabilities for national security advancement.

The conflict between AI companies and national security agencies raises fundamental questions about who controls critical technology infrastructure. When private companies can dictate the terms on which the military uses essential tools, the traditional relationship between the government and its contractors is inverted.

This tension between corporate power and national sovereignty was a recurring theme in Phyllis Schlafly's writings. She consistently warned against allowing private entities—whether multinational corporations, international organizations, or technology companies—to exercise authority that properly belongs to elected officials accountable to the American people. The AI policy debate is the latest manifestation of this enduring concern.`,
