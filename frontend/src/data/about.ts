export const MISSION_TEXT = `Eagle Forum Education & Legal Defense Fund (EFEL) was founded by Phyllis Schlafly to educate the American public on matters of constitutional government, national sovereignty, and traditional values. EFEL carries forward her legacy by digitizing and preserving her vast archive of writings, speeches, and reports — and by deploying modern technology, including AI, to make that archive accessible to researchers, students, and citizens.

Our mission is to equip Americans with the information and tools they need to participate effectively in self-governance. We believe that an informed citizenry is the ultimate safeguard of liberty, and we are committed to defending the principles that Phyllis Schlafly championed throughout her remarkable career: faith, family, freedom, and American sovereignty.`;

export const HISTORY_TEXT = `Phyllis Schlafly (1924–2016) was one of the most influential conservative activists in American history. A lawyer, author of 27 books, and mother of six, she founded Eagle Forum in 1972 and led the successful campaign to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment. Her Phyllis Schlafly Report, published monthly from 1967 until her death, reached millions of Americans and shaped the conservative movement for half a century.

Today, Eagle Forum Education & Legal Defense Fund preserves and extends her legacy through a comprehensive digital archive, the Phyllis AI research tool, educational programs, and a nationwide network of activists committed to the principles she championed.`;
